every npc has at least two goals

goals are ranked in a hierarchy. npcs will prioritize the goals highest on the hierarchy, and act accordingly.

priority represents which goal is at the front of an npc's mind. NOT what is ultimately most important to them long term.

goal priority may change based on the npc's situation

if the pcs know one of an npc's goals, they can affect the hierarchy by dealing hits

maybe... npc moves are stronger the more goals they are acting on

Ranking goals
- goals have a numeric priority value which can shift up or down?
	- stronger npcs have "higher priority" goals? goals with more hit points? kinda weird
- OR goals are only ranked relative to each other
	- stronger npcs could have higher... will, or conviction or wtv which diminishes the effect of hits? blocks hits?

Discovering a goal
- when an NPC uses a move, it reveals whichever goal it is acting on
- when blindly dealing hits to an npc, a relevant goal may be revealed
  - OR the player may ask a question about the npc's goals?
- use special abilities to reveal goals

Shifting a goal
- when you deal a hit to a goal you know about, you can move it up or down in priority

Destroying a goal
- deal X hits to it in a single move?
- goals have hp based on their *long term* priority

Creating a goal
- party makes a move as a group to create a major change in the environment. this temporary goal will incapacitate the npc for the time being
	- collapse a bridge onto a monster. monster gains the goal "get out from under this bridge" at max priority
- pc uses a special ability to create a weakness. this new goal can now be shifted up by subsequent moves.
	- seduce the dragon. dragon gains the goal "find someone who makes life make sense" at low priority
	- i cast sleep. archmage gains the goal "take a refreshing nap" at low priority
	- provoke. the duelist gains the goal "crush this impudent whelp" at low priority
- improvise stuff?
	- subject the prisoner to torture. they gain the goal "make the pain stop" at low priority

Goal armor
- many goals have armor which protects them from certain kinds of move
- you won't convince someone to trust you by beating them
- a goal inflicted by magic might need to be broken by magic

Blind Moves
- a pc can make a move against an npc without targeting a specific goal
- they take a 1d penalty
- the gm decides which goal is targeted, or creates a new goal
