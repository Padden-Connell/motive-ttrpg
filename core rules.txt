""tree game"" is a system for giving npcs complex priorities and motives under a simple framework. it gives player characters (pcs) opportunities to uncover what makes npcs tick, and exploit their unique desires, insecurities, and ambitions.

tree game is about interacting with other people.

it uses a collection of skill trees to empower pcs. this tamps down on the overwhelming buffet of choices during character creation, but allows a greater depth of customization than classed systems.

non player characters are the fundamental challenge presented by tree game. while other games might pour their resources into elaborate battlemaps, loot tables


an npc need not necessarily be an individal person. an organization or community with shared motives might be considered one (very powerful) npc

MOTIVES
=======

motives are the core mechanic tree game is built around. each npc has a list

EMOTIONS
========

emotions are resources accrued by npcs when the pcs move against them.
the GM may spend emotions to resist hits against specific approaches, or to boost certain npc moves.

there are three emotions:
 Anger	indignation, jealousy, spite.	evoked by Fool, spent to resist Fraternize (or boost offensive moves)
 Joy	trust, resolve, determination.	evoked by Fraternize, spent to resist Force (or boost friendly moves)
 Fear	doubt, mistrust, anxiety.	evoked by Force, spent to resist Fool (or boost defensive moves)

generally, in the trees:
 lots of Fool skills exploit Anger
 lots of Fraternize skills exploit Joy
 lots of Force skills exploit Fear
but there are exceptions to this.

NPC TRAITS
==========

traits are unique abilities which allow npcs to break the rules. they are hidden until the GM uses them

- traumatized people-pleaser can spend Fear to appease/manipulate the pcs
- nesting monster can spend Fear to protect its young
- brooding weakling can spend Anger

LEVERAGE
========
npcs can have "leverage" against other characters. leverage is a number between 0 and 4 which represents how much power the npc holds over that person.

1 leverage - the npc is aware of the character.
2 leverage - the npc has a distinct edge over the character- perhaps a superior vantage point, the admiration of the local populace, or a sensitive secret.
3 leverage - the npc controls something the character holds dear- their hopes, dreams, loved ones, or physical health.
4 leverage - the npc could kill the character effortlessly.

an increase in leverage can be a conseqence for a failed roll, a result of choices made in the fiction, or a buff from an npc move.

some npcs are more powerful than others. an immortal archmage might gain 4 leverage against everyone just by walking into the room, while a sickly office clerk with a broadsword doesn't even reach 2 leverage over the average unarmed pc.

many npc moves might have leverage requirements.


[compare leverage to the position mechanic in Blades in the Dark. it indicates what is at stake.]

NPC MOVES
=========

after an npc is moved against, it's their turn!

npcs have a list of moves.

all npcs have the following moves:
- fight
- flee
-
